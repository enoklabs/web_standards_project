			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p><strong>The objective of this project is to examine and find the appropriate redesign approach for the website:
	www.topstone1.com owned by Top Stone Inc.</strong></p><br>
			<p>During the analysis process, I find several areas that need improvement. The website is flat and confusing, therefore lacking proper presentation to the user. There is no layout structure and content is disorganized. The results of the W3C’s validation test showed 83 errors and improper html semantics. Visual design is weak and inconsistent across all pages allowing me to make room for a new and refreshing user experience and overall redesign.</p>
			<p>For a better website’s user interface/experience and overall higher conversion rate, my redesign process will consist of the following changes:</p>
			<ol>
			<em>
				<li>Organize the entire website’s content into 6 web pages.</li>
				<li>Add a logo and a navigational menu at the top of all pages.</li>
				<li>Make a homepage CTA with a clear statement of the website offers.</li>
				<li>Teach visitors what is Top Stone Inc. with a brief summary.</li>
				<li>Promote the physical store’s location and display their catalog.</li>
				<li>Turn online visitors into potential store walk-in customers.</li>
			</em>
			<ol>
